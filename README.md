Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

Description: This repository contains code for analyzing and classifying movie genres based on descriptions. The dataset includes movie titles, descriptions, and genres sourced from IMDb. Techniques such as sentiment analysis, genre distribution visualization, and TF-IDF vectorization are employed. Machine learning models like Linear SVC, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression are utilized to predict and classify movie genres.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing techniques including text processing and feature engineering.
Visualization of genre distributions, sentiment analysis, and word frequency.
Implementation of machine learning models for multi-label classification.
Evaluation metrics and visualization of classification results.
Tools and Libraries:

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, TextBlob, WordCloud.



Task 2: Spam SMS Detection

Description: This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to detect spam SMS messages using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'. Techniques such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training with algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Linear Discriminant Analysis are employed. The repository provides insights into the distribution of spam vs non-spam messages and visualizations of message data.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing including tokenization, stop words removal, and lemmatization.
Visualization of message length distributions and word frequency.
Implementation of machine learning models for binary classification of spam messages.
Evaluation metrics and visualization of model performance.
Tools and Libraries:

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, spaCy, WordCloud.
