Visualization of genre distributions, sentiment analysis, and word frequency.
Implementation of machine learning models for multi-label classification.
Evaluation metrics and visualization of classification results.
Tools and Libraries:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, TextBlob, WordCloud.



Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description:
This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using transaction data. The dataset includes transaction details like amounts, merchant information, and transaction timestamps. Techniques such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees are employed. The repository provides insights into the distribution of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions and visualizations of transaction data correlations.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing including label encoding, feature extraction from timestamps.
Visualization of transaction data distributions, correlations, and geographical patterns.
Implementation of machine learning models for binary classification of fraud transactions.
Evaluation metrics and visualization of model performance.
Tools and Libraries:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn.
